# Analyzing User Behavior on Social Media Platform Z
**Project Description**
This project aims to analyze and understand user behavior on a social media platform referred to as "Platform Z." By leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques, the goal is to identify distinct user categories and provide strategic recommendations to enhance user engagement and retention. The methodology combines exploratory data analysis (EDA), unsupervised clustering, and supervised learning to derive insights from user behavior metrics such as post frequency, word count, question ratio, and URL sharing frequency.

**Key Components of the Project:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
**Data Overview:** The dataset comprises 2307 rows and 13 columns, representing various behavioral metrics of users.
**Correlation Matrix:** Strong positive correlations were identified, such as between InDegree and OutDegree (0.989).
**Duplicate Data:** No duplicate rows were found, ensuring data integrity.
**Box-plot Analysis:** Significant variability was observed in metrics like "TotalPosts" and "meanWordCount."
**Pair-plot:** Highlighted relationships between variables, such as a positive relationship between 'InDegree' and 'OutDegree'.
**Visualizations:** Distribution graphs for Total Posts and Account Age were created to understand user activity levels and account longevity.

**Unsupervised Clustering:**
**K-means Clustering:** The optimal number of clusters was determined to be three using the Elbow Method. Clusters were analyzed for behavioral patterns.
**Silhouette Analysis:** The average silhouette width was 0.27, indicating moderate to high clustering quality.
**Cluster Insights:** Identified three user groups:
**Cluster 1:** Less active users.
**Cluster 2:** Moderately engaged users.
**Cluster 3:** Highly active and influential users.
**Supervised Model** - Support Vector Machine (SVM):

**Confusion Matrix:** The SVM model demonstrated high accuracy (99.96%) in classifying users into the identified clusters.
**Performance Metrics:** High values for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value across all classes.

**Key Findings and Their Impact**
**User Behavior Patterns:**
**Diverse User Activity:** Significant differences in activity levels and content lengths were observed among users.
**Correlation Insights:** Strong correlations among several variables suggest that active users tend to be engaged in multiple ways (e.g., posting frequently, receiving likes).

**Clustering Insights:**

**User Segmentation:** The identification of three distinct user groups provides a basis for targeted engagement strategies.
**Behavioral Differences:** Each cluster exhibits unique behavioral traits, which can inform tailored communication and content strategies.

**Model Accuracy:**
**SVM Superiority:** The SVM model's high accuracy indicates its robustness in classifying users and understanding their behavior, making it a valuable tool for ongoing user analysis.

**Impact on Social Media Platform Z**
E**nhanced User Engagement:** By understanding different user segments, Platform Z can tailor its engagement strategies to meet the needs of various user groups, fostering a more personalized user experience.
**Targeted Marketing and Communication:** Insights from the clusters can guide marketing efforts to engage less active users and leverage the influence of highly active users.
**Strategic Decision Making:** The data-driven approach provides a solid foundation for making informed decisions regarding platform improvements, community management, and user retention strategies.
**Continuous Improvement:** Regularly updating the model with new data will ensure that Platform Z remains responsive to changing user behaviors and preferences, maintaining high levels of user satisfaction and engagement.
By implementing these findings, Platform Z can optimize its user engagement strategies, enhance user satisfaction, and strengthen its competitive position in the social media landscape.
